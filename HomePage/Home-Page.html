      <p> Living an eco-friendly lifestyle can be easier than you may think. Many companies, local and large, have made changes or been set up with the intention to decrease waste. </p>
      <p> Companies such as the Little Green Larder on Perth Road sell organic produce (such as beans, quinoa and apples) waste free. They do this by encouraging customers to bring containers to take away their weighed out product, or purchase a container in the shop </p>
      <p> But it's not just small companies that are encouraging people to reduce their waste. After the Scottish government introduced the 5p bag charge to encourage people to bring their own bags to the shops, many supermarkets have stopped putting the bags at the tills. Instead, opting for "bags for life" and other alternatives made from tougher more expensive plastic or materials like jute. </p>
      <p> While the majority of damage to the environment is caused by large corporations, the consumer can make small changes to their lifestyles that can help to reduce their footprint on the environment. This websites purpose is to educate its users on ways to improve their habits with various applications such as the <a href = "#quiz">quiz</a> where you will be asked a series of questions and will be provided with tips based on your answers. </p>
